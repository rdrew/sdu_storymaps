Opened in 1951, it served the\nUniversity for both sporting and social functions, as well as hosting the\nannual convocation ceremony, until 1969. The gym continued to serve UPEI for\nmore than 20 years, but fell into disuse during the 1990s, following the\nopening of the Canada Winter Games/Chi-Wan Young fieldhouse. It was to be\nincorporated into UPEI’s new Student Centre, but an\naccidental fire during early construction of the Centre destroyed the Gym in\n2001: the two stone torches on the East wall of the Murphy Student Centre were\nsalvaged from the facade of the Alumni Gymnasium. <em>Building Illustration by\nSterling Stratton</em>.</p>"

Though less grandiose than\nfirst envisioned in the early 1850s, Main Building’s\nunderstated but distinguished architecture has stood the test of time:\noriginally the sum total of SDU’s\nphysical plant (apart from a campus farm and some outbuildings), Main Building\nhad to meet all of SDU’s residence,\nadministrative, and teaching needs until 1917, when Dalton Hall opened; it\nremained a multi-role facility thereafter, housing classrooms, offices, and a\nmen’s residence into the\n1960s. UPEI embarked on an extensive but sympathetic renovation in the 1980s,\nand its numerous offices and lecture halls (as well as the Faculty Lounge)\nensure that Main will be a campus focal point for many years to come.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>"

During the UPEI era, the building became home to the\nMusic Department in 1975, and the chapel was converted into a recital hall,\nnamed in honour of Dr. G. Douglas Steel, former Principal of Prince of Wales\nCollege and a keen music education advocate. The lower level of the facility\ncontinued to accommodate the campus kitchen and cafeteria until 1991, at which\ntime it was extensively remodelled to house the new School of Nursing, opened\nin 1992.

Dalton\nwas also a devout Catholic — he\nreceived a Papal knighthood in 1917, the same year construction began on Dalton\nHall — so\nSt. Dunstan’s was a fitting\nobject for his charity. The handsome edifice bearing his name — its\narchitecture strongly influenced by the Collegiate Gothic style — served\nSDU, and then UPEI, as a residence hall until 1972. It was then renovated for\nclassroom and office use, and housed the Home Economics/Family &amp;\nNutritional Sciences department for many years.
